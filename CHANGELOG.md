# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and
this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

`.github/workflows/release.yml` parses the section matching the tag being
released. A tag with no matching section here fails the release job.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- ADR 0002 (Bubble export strategy) and ADR 0003 (read-only freeze cutover).
- `project-conventions` filled in with the project's settled decisions, domain
  vocabulary, guardrails, and the current enforcement blind spots.
- A `references/failure-modes.md` row for the stacked-PR merge that closed a
  dependent pull request irrecoverably, and the merge order that prevents it.
- `main-guard.yml`, which fails when a commit reaches `main` without a pull
  request. It detects a bypass after the fact and cannot prevent one; server-side
  prevention needs GitHub Pro or a public repository (issue #9).
- ADR 0004 (calendar integration), 0005 (data platform) and 0006 (messaging
  build-vs-buy), plus `docs/adr/README.md` as the index, and settled decisions
  12–19 with the `port`, `ror_id` and `conversation_id` vocabulary.

### Changed

- Target Python 3.14 across `.python-version`, `requires-python`, ruff and mypy.
- CI tests a single interpreter instead of a 3.12/3.13 matrix — this is a
  deployed application, not a library consumed on many Python versions.
- CI and the release workflow select steps from `scripts/check.py` with `--only`
  instead of restating the commands, so the gate is defined once. The bandit
  step gains `-c pyproject.toml`, which the restated CI copy had dropped.
- `[tool.check-layers.forbidden-external]` now covers `api` and `core` as well as
  `domain`, and names the adopted vendor SDKs, so "no vendor SDK outside `infra/`"
  is enforced rather than only documented. It is a denylist: a newly adopted
  vendor is unguarded until its package name is added alongside the dependency.

### Fixed

- The shared `settings` test fixture no longer reads the developer's `.env`;
  any field it did not pin explicitly was taking that file's value.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-01

### Added

- Project skeleton: `src/app/{api,domain,infra,core}` with the layer boundary
  enforced by `scripts/check_layers.py`.
- Configuration through `core/config.py` only, rejecting misspelled
  `EDUFURTHER_` environment variables at startup.
- `GET /health` liveness endpoint.
- Full local gate via `scripts/check.py`, wrapped by `make check`.
- CI, security, and release workflows; pre-commit hooks including secret
  scanning and Conventional Commits.
